## Asynchronous Generators

Asynchronous generators are a powerful feature in Python that allows you to write code that can be paused and resumed, making it ideal for I/O-bound tasks. To write an asynchronous generator, you can use the async for statement.

Here's an example of an asynchronous generator that generates prime numbers:

async def async_primes():
    primes = []
    num = 2
    while True:
        for prime in primes:
            if num % prime == 0:
                break
        else:
            primes.append(num)
            yield num
        num += 1
        await asyncio.sleep(0)

In this example, we define an asynchronous generator function async_primes that generates an infinite sequence of prime numbers. We use the async for statement to iterate over the primes list and check if the current number is divisible by any of the primes. If it is not, we append it to the primes list and yield it. We also use asyncio.sleep(0) to allow other tasks to run.

## Async Comprehensions

Async comprehensions are a shorthand way of writing asynchronous generators. They work similarly to list comprehensions, but instead of using the [] brackets, you use the async for statement.

Here's an example of an async comprehension that generates the same sequence of prime numbers as the previous example:

async def async_primes_comprehension():
    primes = []
    num = 2
    while True:
        primes = [p for p in primes if (num % p) != 0] + [num]
        num += 1
        yield num
        await asyncio.sleep(0)

In this example, we define an async comprehension function async_primes_comprehension that generates the same sequence of prime numbers as the previous example. We use the async for statement to iterate over the primes list and filter out any numbers that are not prime. We then append the current number to the primes list and yield it.

## Type-annotating Generators

Type annotations are a way of specifying the types of variables and functions in Python. They can be used to improve code readability and catch type-related errors at compile time.

To type-annotate a generator, you can use the Generator type from the typing module. Here's an example of a type-annotated generator that generates prime numbers:

from typing import Generator, List, Union

async def async_primes_typed() -> Generator[int, None, None]:
    primes: List[int] = []
    num: int = 2
    while True:
        for prime in primes:
            if num % prime == 0:
                break
        else:
            primes.append(num)
            yield num
        num += 1
        await asyncio.sleep(0)

In this example, we define a type-annotated asynchronous generator function async_primes_typed that generates an infinite sequence of prime numbers. We use the Generator type from the typing module to specify that the function returns a generator. We also use type annotations to specify the types of the primes list, the num variable, and the asyncio.sleep function.

## Conclusion

In this README, we explored how to write asynchronous generators, use async comprehensions, and type-annotate generators in Python. Asynchronous generators and async comprehensions are powerful features that can be used to write efficient and scalable code for I/O-bound tasks. Type annotations can be used to improve code readability and catch type-related errors at compile time.
