# Introduction to Python Async Functions

Asynchronous programming, or async programming, is a way to manage and execute tasks concurrently. It enables more efficient use of system resources, particularly for tasks involving network requests, where the execution can be paused while waiting for a response.

In Python, the `asyncio` library is used for writing asynchronous code. This library provides a high-level API for asynchronously executing coroutines, which are a type of function that can be paused and resumed.

Here is a basic example of how to define and call an async function:

```python
import asyncio

async def my_async_function():
    print("Starting my async function")
    await asyncio.sleep(1) # Pause for 1 second
    print("Finished my async function")

# Call the async function
asyncio.run(my_async_function())
